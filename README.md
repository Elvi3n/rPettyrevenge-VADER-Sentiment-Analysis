# rPettyrevenge-Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis on Reddit posts using the PRAW library for scraping and the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer for text analysis. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook.


### Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

*Reddit API credentials are required. Create a Reddit app by following the OAuth2 Quick Start Guide*
. Update your client ID, client secret, and user agent in the notebook before running.

## Workflow

- 1) Web Scraping:

- Collects posts from a target subreddit using PRAW.
  - Stores titles, bodies, and URLs in a structured DataFrame.

- 2) Sentiment Analysis:

  - Applies VADER to calculate negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores.
  - Stores sentiment scores in the DataFrame.

## Findings

- Highest sentiment score (positive): 0.99
- Lowest sentiment score (negative): -0.99

### Distribution Plot

The histogram below shows that posts cluster in the pettyrevenge subreddiit at the extremes. Meaning the subreddit’s content is polarized: people either narrate their stories with deep negativity or with triumphant positivity, likely from their success in taking revenge. The lack of middle-ground suggests that revenge stories are emotionally charged by nature.
